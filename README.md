## **MY WORK**
I have made 2 HTTP Stats and 1 CPU Stats

## **1st HTTP Stat**
This Grafana dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of application performance within a specified time range. By accessing it via the URL, users can monitor key metrics such as system performance, request processing times, error rates, and other critical data points in real time. The "panel-1" view highlights specific details, enabling teams to identify trends, troubleshoot issues, and ensure application reliability and stability effectively.

## **2st HTTP Stat**
This Grafana dashboard provides insights into application performance within the selected time range, focusing on the data visualized in "panel-3." It displays key metrics such as server health, resource usage, and response times, helping to identify bottlenecks, performance degradation, or unusual activity. By analyzing these metrics, users can take proactive measures to optimize the system, address potential issues, and maintain application stability and efficiency.

## **CPU Stat**
This Grafana dashboard, focusing on "panel-2," provides a visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) for the application during the selected time range. It likely includes metrics such as user activity, API request volume, or error rates, offering valuable insights into the app's usage and behavior. By analyzing this data, you can monitor traffic trends, detect potential issues, and ensure the application is performing optimally. This panel helps track the overall health and user interaction with the app, enabling data-driven decisions for improvement.
